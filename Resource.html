                <a href="https://youtu.be/ViDtnfQ9FHc">Intersectionality</a> is a way of understanding structural
                inequality
                and
                injustices and analyzing the complexity in how different aspects of a person's social and political
                identities
                (like gender, race, class, sexuality, and ability) combine to create unique experiences of
                discrimination or
                privilege.
